//! File logging on every platform, for reports that come in after the fact.
//!
//! The app writes `notmusic.log` beside its settings (see `data_dir`), keeping the
//! previous run as `notmusic.prev.log` — the run that crashed is the interesting one,
//! and it must survive the relaunch. Warnings and errors land there from every part
//! of the app, panics included, so a silent "it just disappeared" report comes with
//! evidence. The sign-in webview children log to their own file, since they are
//! separate processes that outlive the user's patience for watching them.
//!
//! `RUST_LOG` (or `YTM_DEFAULT_LOG` for a test build) picks the filter as usual;
//! `YTM_LOG=<path>` sends the main log somewhere else instead.
